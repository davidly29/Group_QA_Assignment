Clear and meaningful variable names.
-	Good variable names increase readability of code for users.
-	Use comments to explain logic in code.
-	Helps make long lasting code.
-	Unclear names make unclear code, Avoid (temp, data, p1)
-	If unsure use Hungarian notation for guidelines.
-	Avoid synonyms in naming conventions
Well documented code
-	Well documented code is often reused due to its clear definition and explanation.
-	Good documentation encourages maintainability, understandability and legibility.
-	Can help define expected outcome of code, and in turn help debug errors that may arise.
-	Helps make sure the code is staying true to the defined scope.
Indentation
-	Good white spacing helps to improve readability.
-	Nested blocks should be indented.
-	Multiple conditionals should be indented to avoid confusing brackets.
Error Handling
-	Error conditional functions should always return something, to aid the user debugging.
-	Provide useful error messages in your code, this helps identify the problem regardless if the error is due to user input or developer incompetence.
-	Console log unexpected behaviour to help aid others to understand the code.
Testing
-	Write tests before development. This will help the developer to stick to the spec and helps make the code measurable and adhere to the expected behaviour.
-	Make sure that the test coverage covers the code that you have developed. And that all conditionals paths are accounted for.
-	Whenever implementing a new piece of code, run ALL test suits to make sure that the code change doesnâ€™t impact other areas of the application.
-	If the code has any specific behaviour, make sure this is tested.
-	Testing should be done with test data and real data.
