# ProjectPlan: 

## Team Members
- Niamh Mc Nulty

- Gillian O Connor 

- David Lynch 

- Emma Grealy


## Topics to be covered:

Topics: |Assigned To:
------------ | -------------
Task Estimation: | All 4 as Group
Code Standards: | Emma and David
Code Review :   | Niamh and Gillian

## Steps to be taken: 

1. David creates the master branch and also creates the develop branch 
    - Add the rest of us as collaborators, where each of us accept the invitation.

2. The other team members then fork Davids source respository.

3. Each member clones this respository created to their local machines. 
    > git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-flow-exercise.git

    i.e. cloning the fork copy not the orginal.  

4. Ensure the relevant branches are there:
    > git branch 

    Notice the result of this will only be local branch:
    >*master

    Next need to search for remote branches:
    > git branch - r
    
    Then checkout the develop branch, in order to get local copy:
    > git checkout develop

5. Create a feature branch for each topic -- Create this off the develop branch 

6. Research your given topic and find 5 good quality resources (articles, blog posts etc) related to the topic and identify common themes among those resources. 

    - Briefly introduce the topic.
    - Summarize most important guidelines in bullet points / diagrams.  
    

7. Commit regulary to the corresponding feature branch. On complete merge to the develop branch, by making a pull request. 

8. Ensure team members review and give feedback on all pull requests. 

9. On completion, have a group retrospective. Identify what went well and what could have been done better.

# Project Retrospective: 

- The guidelines in the plan gave clear instructions on how to set up the project on everyoneâ€™s device. The plan was followed and appreciated throughout. Having designated team members to work with on feature branches before starting saved time. 

- However, If this project was to be redone we would have practiced the git flow process before beginning the repository as by doing it would allow us to understand the git flow more confidently.  

- The team worked seamlessly when problems with the git flow process arose, by helping each other remotely whenever needed. 

- Adjusting to our new working environment, we had to communicate virtually through online video meetings which was very helpful when any difficult issues occurred.  

- Initially, the git flow process proved challenging as this was our first time working collaboratively using git. However, there were many learning outcomes to this project. When it reached working on the task-estimation branch, pull requests and the git flow process was fully understood. 

- Skills including working within version control environment, finding appropriate resources and taking useful information from them, creating our own diagrams from Canva rather than just using google images was achieved throughout this project.  

- Doing the assignment again we believe merging each branch into develop branch on completion would prove more beneficial to us as by doing so would reduce the chance of conflicts when merging to the develop branch. 

- Initially the pull requests were being used and merged before receiving feedback, this situation was rectified with more practice of the process.
