Code review is an activity part of the software quality assurance. This is where the source code is broken into small pieces an inspected by one or more team member(s) which is to be carried out just before testing. Code review is done in order to detect mistakes, catch early bugs and ensure that the code follows the standard practices. Implementing code reviews is one of the relatively cheapest ways to detect and reduce bugs at an early stage. 


## Objectives:

If the style of code is under compliance by all policies

If there is any breach of security and most importantly 

If the code can be understood easily or not




- #### Include all team members, donâ€™t isolate to yourself:  

    Regardless developer experience, all code must be reviewed. Developers will produce the highest quality work once they know their code is being review by a fellow team member. Including a software engineer and architect whilst reviewing helps different issues to be detected.  Including multiple people in the code review in turn improves collaboration and relationships between developers.
