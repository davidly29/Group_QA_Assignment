# Task Estimation 

Task Estimation involves the process of estimating and predicting the total effort that’s required to complete a task and get it to stage where it meets the “Definition of Done”, i.e. when the product is ready to be deliver to the Customer. While estimations are based on assumptions and imperfect knowledge, most estimations have uncertainty. However, the objective of task estimation is to get an estimate of the time, money and number of people required to finish the defined task.
