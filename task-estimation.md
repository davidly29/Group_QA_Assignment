# Task Estimation 

**_Task Estimation_** involves the process of estimating and predicting the total effort that’s required to complete a task and get it to stage where it meets the “Definition of Done”, i.e. when the product is ready to be deliver to the Customer. While estimations are based on assumptions and imperfect knowledge, most estimations have uncertainty. However, the objective of task estimation is to get an estimate of the time, money and number of people required to finish the defined task. 

## Task Estimation Techniques 

**_Planning techniques_** are essential for Test estimation. A template pattern can be used to guarantee requirements and other aspects of the project are met. Some of the most common and important techniques for test estimation are: 

**1) Test Point estimation:** this is used across industry in testing as it is a simple and easily understandable estimation technique. Iterative phases and simplicity are the most important features of this technique. 

**2) Work-phase based estimation:**  is used where a guess estimate is made on a particular phase and then the testing team gradually adds on other phases into the initial estimation and finally comes up with an appropriate estimation. The testing team also needs to visualize the potential risks and threats and pitfalls which lie may lie for the team in the future. 

**3) Use-Case Point estimation:**  estimation on the use cases where the unadjusted actor weights and unadjusted use case weights are used to determine the software testing estimation. 

**4) Functional point analysis:** This method consists of assigning each functional point a weighted number based on difficulty. Ranking each from 1-5, with 1 (simple), 3 (medium), or 5 (complex).

# Testing Tasks
**_Testing Tasks_** Firstly involves research of the project. At this stage of the project members read through and analyse tje project documentation. From doing this, it will allow the team to get a good overview of the project and discuss and resolve and questions or problems that may arise. After this plannig is done we can the move on into thee flow of testing our tasks, this is done in various ways to ensure that there is an adherent flow to the development and logic surrounding the tests that are being written.

# Testing Tasks Techniques
**1) Analysis of products:** This allows the users to understand the product that the tests are being developed for. EG: Who uses the product ?, What problem does the product solve ?, What gives the product value ?, How does the product work ?
**2) Design a test strategy:** This document is important when writing tests as it defines two main points crucial to test development, the Testing objectives and the determination off the costs and efforts needed.
**3) Define Test Objective:** is used to define the overall direction and goal for the tests, this helps keep the tests focused to the core functionality of the product.
# Conducting and evaluating tests
This is done when tests are being carried out, when conducting test suites, the data that you use to test is as important as the test itself, depending on the data inputted into a test it may change the expected behaviour of the test. It is also important to make sure that the test are ran in both isolation and as a suit, this will make sure that the tests written are comprehensive and cover different types of behaviors of the application.
# Building Test Case
WWhen building test cases it is important to be clear and concise. This means that the test cases should be clear and to the point, the steps and all relevant data to carry out the test should also be included within the spec. The expected result from the test should also be defined in the case, as this may help other users understand the logic of the test and also identify unexpected behaviour. Assumptions and preconceptions should be included in the test case, as this will help to assist new users when establishing any preconditions required for the test.
